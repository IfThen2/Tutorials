# Dependency Injection, Dependency Inversion, and the Inversion of Control

## In one sentence...

`Dependency Injection` is a design pattern we can implement, along with proper abstractions, to
achieve `Dependency Inversion`. It is one specific implementation of `Inversion of Control`.

## Unwrapping the Mess

In my experience, most developers first experience with DI in Java is often with one of the big IoC
frameworks. These frameworks are really an amalgamation of several related techniques, principles,
features, etc. This can often obfuscate what, at its root, is a fairly simple concept to wrap your
head around, or even implement yourself. So, let's try to untangle some of these principles, and in
the process, examine their benefits.

## Dependency Injection

`Dependency injection` is a __design pattern__ in which what a class *needs* is separated from what
it
*does*. Instead of creating their dependencies internally, Classes accept them as formal
parameters (_constructor, setters, properties_). It can be implemented with just two steps:

1) Writing classes that accept their dependencies as parameters via constructor, setter, etc, and
2) Managing the creation, passing around (injection), and general life cycle of said dependencies
   somewhere else (as simple as the first few lines of your main method...)

### Dependency Inversion

`Dependency inversion` is a __design principle__ which asserts that higher level classes should not
depend on low lower level classes. That is, classes should not be tightly coupled with their
dependent classes.

We accomplish through the use of abstractions (interfaces), reducing coupling and increasing the
re-usability and extensibility of the code.

#### Inversion of Control (_Don't call us, we'll call you..."_)

Inversion of Control is a design principle

With these definitions, you can see how dependency injection alone is not sufficient to achieve
dependency inversion.

## Benefits

So now that we know what Dependency Injection / Dependency inversion are, and how to implement them,
the million dollar question becomes... Why should we? Other than adhering to design principles that
you read in a book somewhere, what are the tangible, practical benefits for the developer?

Benefits : //todo shorten the call stack

1) Declarative Classes - When all of your classes declare their needs/dependencies right up there at
   the top, your code becomes much easier to reason about.
2) Easier Testing - We have much better control over isolating the behavior of our class we want to
   test, because we can now mock/stub all the dependencies and completely control their behavior.
3) Looser coupling - Changes to the way a dependency is created / obtained no longer require changes
   in every class that uses it, since we've abstracted the creation of that dependency to somewhere
   higher up the food chain.

Benefits with Dependency inversion added:

Loosely coupled components aren't as brittle and are less prone to breaking.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Increased Flexibility</h3>

We can easily swap out the specific implementations of dependencies without updating the classes
that use them

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Faster Development</h3>

Multiple teams can agree on high level interfaces at the beginning of a project, then dependent
classes can be developed simultaneously
