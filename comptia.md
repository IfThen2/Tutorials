I think it only makes sense to start at the beginning, so let's tackle the first objective and
identify the basic features of Microsoft Windows editions.

## 1.1. Identify basic features of Microsoft Windows editions.

**Windows 10 Home**: Designed for the average consumer, Windows 10 Home offers a user-friendly
experience with features like Cortana, Microsoft Edge, and the Start Menu. It's suitable for
everyday tasks and entertainment and is a popular choice for home users.

**Windows 10 Pro**: Windows 10 Pro is built for business and power users. It includes all the
features of Windows 10 Home plus additional security and management tools like BitLocker, remote
desktop access, and the ability to join a domain. It's an excellent choice for small businesses and
professionals.

**Windows 10 Pro for Workstations**: This edition is designed for high-performance PCs and
workstations. It includes features like ReFS (Resilient File System) and support for high-end
hardware configurations, making it ideal for users who need exceptional performance and reliability.

**Windows 10 Enterprise**: Geared towards large organizations and businesses, Windows 10 Enterprise
offers advanced security, management, and deployment features. It includes Windows Defender
Credential Guard, AppLocker, and Windows To Go, making it suitable for enterprises with complex IT
infrastructures.

**Windows 10 Education**: Windows 10 Education builds on the commercial version of Windows 10 Pro
but is tailored for educational institutions. It provides tools for educators and students,
including enhanced security, simplified deployment, and access to Microsoft's education-specific
apps and services.

### 1.1.1. Upgrade Paths

Upgrade paths, in the context of Windows 10, refer to the routes or options available for
transitioning from an older Windows operating system, such as Windows 7 or Windows 8, to Windows10.
These paths outline which editions of Windows 10 are accessible based on the edition of the older
Windows OS you are currently using. The upgrade path also specifies whether it's a full upgrade (
which includes preserving personal data, settings, and applications) or a downgrade (where personal
data is maintained, but applications and settings are removed). Understanding upgrade paths is
essential for individuals planning to migrate to Windows 10, as it helps them determine which
edition they can move to and what data they should expect to retain during the upgrade process.

### 1.1.2. BitLocker

BitLocker is a built-in feature in Windows operating systems that provides data encryption and
security for your computer's hard drive or other storage devices. It works by encrypting the entire
drive, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized users to access your data without the
appropriate encryption key. Sample BitLocker use-case from a user's perspective:
Enable BitLocker: Go to the Control Panel, select "System and Security," and click on "BitLocker
Drive Encryption." From there, you can choose which drive you want to encrypt and follow the setup
wizard. Choose Your Unlock Method: You'll be asked to choose how you want to unlock the drive.
Options typically include using a password, a PIN, or a USB drive. Select the one that suits your
preference and security needs. Backup Your Recovery Key: BitLocker will generate a recovery key that
you should store in a safe place. This key is essential in case you forget your password or PIN, as
it allows you to regain access to your encrypted drive. Start Encryption: Once you've configured
your settings and saved the recovery key, BitLocker will begin encrypting your drive in the
background. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the drive. Restart Your
Computer: After the encryption is complete, you may need to restart your computer. BitLocker will
prompt you to enter your password, PIN, or insert the USB drive to unlock the encrypted drive every
time you boot your computer.

BitLocker provides an added layer of security to protect your data from unauthorized access,
especially in the event that your computer or storage device is lost or stolen.

### 1.1.3. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

First introduced in 1998 for Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
is a technology developed by Microsoft that allows users to connect to and control a remote computer
or server over a network. With RDP, you can access and interact with a remote desktop as if you were
physically present in front of it. This technology is commonly used for remote administration,
technical support, or accessing resources on a remote machine. To use RDP, the remote computer must
be running a Windows operating system, and you need proper credentials and permissions to establish
a secure connection. RDP provides a convenient way to work on distant computers, troubleshoot
issues, or manage remote servers efficiently. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is not available in
Windows 10 Home Edition. It is a feature included in Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education,
Windows 10 Education, and Windows 10 Enterprise editions. These editions are designed to provide
more advanced networking and remote access capabilities, which include RDP, making them suitable for
business and professional use cases. Windows 10 Home, on the other hand, is intended for consumer
and basic home use and lacks some of these advanced networking features.

### 1.1.4. Domain Access vs. Workgroup

Access Domain access and workgroup access are two different ways to manage networked computers in a
Windows environment. In a domain, computers are part of a centralized network managed by a server,
often referred to as a domain controller. This setup allows for centralized user authentication,
security policies, and resource management. Users log in using domain credentials, and
administrators can control access, enforce security policies, and manage resources centrally. On the
other hand, in a workgroup, computers are more decentralized. Each computer maintains its own user
accounts and security settings, and users typically log in with local accounts unique to each
machine. Workgroups are suitable for small networks or peer-to-peer setups where centralized
management and security aren't as critical. Domain access provides more robust control and
scalability, making it suitable for larger networks and organizations, while workgroups are simpler
and easier to set up for smaller, less complex environments. In Windows 10, every edition except for
Windows 10 Home supports domain access. Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro Education, Windows 10
Education, and Windows 10 Enterprise editions all have the capability to join and connect to
domains, making them suitable for business and enterprise environments where centralized network
management and security are essential. Windows 10 Home, being more consumer-oriented, doesn't
include this feature.

### 1.1.5. Group Policy Editor

gpedit.msc stands for Group Policy Editor. It's a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) application
that allows users to manage various Windows system settings and policies in a centralized and
organized way. Group policies are a set of rules and configurations that control the working
environment of user accounts and computer accounts in Windows. Here's a brief explanation:
Group Policy Editor is primarily used by system administrators and advanced users to:
Manage System Policies: It enables administrators to configure policies that affect the behavior and
settings of Windows operating systems. These policies can control security settings, application
settings, network configurations, and more. Enforce Security: Administrators can use Group Policy to
enforce security measures across a network, such as password policies, access controls, and firewall
rules. Customize User Experience: Group Policy allows for the customization of the Windows user
interface, including hiding or showing specific elements of the operating system. Deploy Software:
Administrators can use Group Policy to deploy and manage software installations and updates across a
network of Windows computers. Centralized Management: It provides a centralized location to
configure and manage these policies across multiple computers in an Active Directory domain or on a
local computer.

To access gpedit.msc, you can open the Run dialog (Windows Key + R), type gpedit.msc, and press
Enter. Please note that gpedit.msc is not available in Windows Home editions; it's typically found
in Windows Pro, Education, and Enterprise editions.

## 1.2. Given a scenario, use the appropriate Microsoft command-line tool.

### 1.2.1. cd / chdir: Full Microsoft doc here.

  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  your_router_IP
  2     5 ms     4 ms     3 ms  ISP_router_IP
  3     8 ms     9 ms     8 ms  some_other_router_IP
  4    15 ms    14 ms    16 ms  destination_router_IP

Trace complete.
```

#### Trace Route with Maximum Hops and Timeout:

```
C:\>tracert -h 15 -w 500 www.example.com
Tracing route to www.example.com [93.184.216.34]
over a maximum of 15 hops:

  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  your_router_IP

  4    15 ms    14 ms    16 ms  destination_router_IP

Trace complete.
```

Any timeouts are indicated by an `*`. A timeout can occur for various reasons, such as network
congestion, router configuration, or a firewall blocking the ICMP packets used by tracert. It's not
uncommon to see occasional timeouts, especially on the public internet where there are many factors
affecting packet delivery.

### 1.2.15 format: Full Microsoft doc here.

various criteria.

#### Command Syntax:

```
XCOPY source [destination] [/A | /M] [/D[:date]] [/P] [/S [/E]] [/V] [/W]
                           [/C] [/I] [/Q] [/F] [/L] [/G] [/H] [/R] [/T] [/U]
                           [/K] [/N] [/O] [/X] [/Y] [/-Y] [/Z] [/B] [/J]
                           [/EXCLUDE:file1[+file2][+file3]...] [/COMPRESS]
```

Options:

- `source` : Specifies the file(s) to copy.
- `destination` : Specifies the location and/or name of new files.
- `/A` : Copies only files with the archive attribute set, doesn't change the attribute.
- `/M` : Copies only files with the archive attribute set, turns off the archive attribute.
- `/D:m-d-y` : Copies files changed on or after the specified date. If no date is given, copies only
  those files whose source time is newer than the destination time.
- `/EXCLUDE:file1[+file2][+file3]...` : Specifies a list of files containing strings. Each string
  should be in a separate line in the files. When any of the strings match any part of the absolute
  path of the file to be copied, that file will be excluded from being copied. For example,
  specifying a string like \obj\ or .obj will exclude all files underneath the directory obj or all
  files with the .obj extension respectively.
- `/P` : Prompts you before creating each destination file.
- `/S` : Copies directories and subdirectories except empty ones.
- `/E` : Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty ones. Same as /S /E. May be used to
  modify /T.
- `/V` : Verifies the size of each new file.
- `/W` : Prompts you to press a key before copying.
- `/C` : Continues copying even if errors occur.
- `/I` : If destination does not exist and copying more than one file, assumes that destination must
  be a directory.
- `/Q` : Does not display file names while copying.
- `/F` : Displays full source and destination file names while copying.
- `/L` : Displays files that would be copied.
- `/G` : Allows the copying of encrypted files to destination that does not support encryption.
- `/H` : Copies hidden and system files also.
- `/R` : Overwrites read-only files.
- `/T` : Creates directory structure, but does not copy files. Does not include empty directories or
  subdirectories. /T /E includes empty directories and subdirectories.
- `/U` : Copies only files that already exist in destination.
- `/K` : Copies attributes. Normal Xcopy will reset read-only attributes.
- `/N` : Copies using the generated short names.
- `/O` : Copies file ownership and ACL information.
- `/X` : Copies file audit settings (implies /O).
- `/Y` : Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
- `/-Y` : Causes prompting to confirm you want to overwrite an existing destination file.
- `/Z` : Copies networked files in restartable mode.
- `/B` : Copies the Symbolic Link itself versus the target of the link.
- `/J` : Copies using unbuffered I/O. Recommended for very large files.
- `/COMPRESS` : Request network compression during file transfer where applicable.

#### Basic File Copy:

```
C:\>xcopy C:\Source\file.txt D:\Destination\
